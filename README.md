The Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the world's most popular T20 cricket tournaments, aims to leverage historical data to uncover actionable insights on player performance, team strategies, match outcomes, and fan engagement trends. The objective is to analyze match-by-match data, player statistics, and season trends to support franchise decision-making in player auctions, match tactics, audience engagement, and performance forecasting.

Dataset Description

The IPL dataset includes detailed information about each seasonâ€™s matches, player performances, ball-by-ball deliveries, team details, and match results. It enables rich analysis of game outcomes, player efficiency, team strategies, venue advantages, and performance trends across different IPL seasons.

    Who are the top 5 bowlers based on runs conceded per over (economy rate)?
    Which batsman has faced the most balls?
    Which bowling team has taken part in the most overs?
    What is the average number of runs scored per ball by each batsman?
    Which teams have the best win percentage according to the team_performance table?
    List all players who are all-rounders (both batting and bowling style available).
    What is the average number of runs scored per over by each batting team?
